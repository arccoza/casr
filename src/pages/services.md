Be it conferencing, weddings, banqueting or an intimate function, we offer it all.  Functions can be arranged inside our restaurant, on its lovely outside deck, in the garden or even next to one of our sparkling swimming pools.  The Christiana All Seasons Resort offers fully catered meals, game viewing, putt-putt, swimming, lush lawns, and childrenâ€™s playground.  The resort also boasts an on-site theatre, ideal for that special product launch. Fishing at the banks of the Vaal river is also possible, just be sure to bring your permit along.
