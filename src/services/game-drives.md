Be inspired by the serenity of the African bush. We offer game viewing in our adjacent 1194 hectares game farm, of which about ten kilometres runs on the banks of the Vaal River. Game species include Springbuck, Kudu, Impala, Orex, Waterbuck, Giraffe, Zebra, Ostrich, and Black Wildebeest. Enquire with reception to book a game drive in our specialised game viewing vehicles.
